## grat

grat is an income tracker and visualizer for all gratuity-based employees. It functions on "shifts", which are aggregate objects of data, most importantly income, but also coworkers, morale, sales, and other specific details. 
## The layout of this folder

`grat` is the backend folder, and `grat-frontend` is the Expo & React Native UI. Also in this folder is `grat Log`, which is a markdown file containing specific updates I logged by time. You can see the progression of the development of this app, and my thoughts along with it, in the logs. The only other important file is `grat product backlog` which shows the features I wanted/still want to implement. 
## I leave all other important information to my slides and my project-planning doc. 

This was an enjoyable experience as I got the chance to learn a ton more about this stack!
